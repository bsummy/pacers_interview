Responses for Indiana Pacers basketball analytics internship.

Question #1:

    Create an analytically driven presentation using publicly available stats (NBA.com,
    BasketballReference, Spotrac, etc.) in your preferred format (PowerPoint/Word/BI Tool, Max: 5
    Slides / Paragraphs) to showcase who realistic targets should be for the Pacers upcoming
    offseason. Detail the Pacersâ€™ needs based on current strengths/weaknesses, as well as at least
    one free agent and why they fit what the Pacers may need. Also, choose one player that may be
    able to be acquired from another team that you believe is undervalued based on analytics.

Question #2:

    Using the attached CSVs and coding language/program of your choice, create 4 plots that
    showcase how the Pacers perform in each of the Four Factors (eFG%, OREB%, TOV%, FTM Rate)
    compared to their opponent and league average on a game-to-game basis in Wins vs. Losses.

    Using the created plots, which factor was most important to the Pacers success (or failure)?


Question #3
Using left and inner joins only, use the table structures in the attached Excel file to write mock-SQL queries based on the below questions:
    - Find the average points per game for each player in the '2022' season who currently
    plays for a team in the 'Western' conference. Include the player's full name and the
    average points.

    - Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the total number of playoff games
    played by each team in the '2022' season. Display the team's full name and the total
    number of games played.

    - Find the player who has the highest minutes per game in the '2022' playoffs, considering
    players who have started at least 50% of the playoff games they played. Include the
    player's full name and the average minutes per game.

    - Retrieve the top 5 players with the highest average points per game in the '2022' regular
    season, considering only players who have played for a team in the playoffs. Include the
    player's full name, average points per game, and the team they are currently playing for.
